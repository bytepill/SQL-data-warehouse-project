1.	**Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2.	**Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3.	**Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

**ðŸ“– Project Overview**

This project involves:
1.	**Data Architecture**: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
2.	**ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
3.	**Data Modeling**: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
4.	**Analytics & Reporting**: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

**ðŸš€ Project Requirements**

Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

**Objective**:

Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.


**Specifications**:

â€¢	Data Sources: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.

â€¢	Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.

â€¢	Integration: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.

â€¢	Scope: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.

â€¢	Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In the **EDA phase**, we analyze raw and transformed data to understand its structure, quality, and underlying patterns.  
Key tasks include:
- Examining data distributions and statistics
- Exploring date ranges, dimensions, and measures
- Identifying data quality issues
- Ranking and magnitude analysis

These steps help ensure the data is consistent and ready for deeper analytics.

## ðŸ“ˆ Advanced Data Analytics

Advanced analytics provides actionable business insights beyond basic reporting.  
Implemented advanced analyses include:
- Change-over-time analysis to detect trends  
- Cumulative and part-to-whole analysis to monitor aggregate growth  
- Data segmentation to identify customer and product clusters  
- Performance analysis for evaluating KPIs  
- Custom reports for customers and product performance  

These analyses support data-driven decision-making and strategic business actions.
