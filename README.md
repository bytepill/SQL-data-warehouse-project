**🚀 Project Requirements**

Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

**Objective**:
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.


**Specifications**:
•	Data Sources: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
•	Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
•	Integration: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
•	Scope: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
•	Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
